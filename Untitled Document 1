Dear Maam,

I would like to request a half-day leave on 17th feb due to personal reason. I have already completed all pending tasks and informed my colleagues about the work that needs to be done in my absence. I assure you that I will complete all tasks before leaving and will be available on phone and email in case of any urgent matter.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Bibek Basnet
