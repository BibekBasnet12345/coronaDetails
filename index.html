        The COVID-19 pandemic is a global outbreak of coronavirus, an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.
    </br> <br/>

        The first cases of novel coronavirus (nCoV) were first detected in China in December 2019, with the virus spreading rapidly to other countries across the world. This led WHO to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and to characterize the outbreak as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, over 2 million people in the European Region have died from the disease.

    <h3>COVID-19 in Nepal</h3>
      <i> <p id="nepal">The coronavirus pandemic, also known as COVID-19, first emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and quickly spread around the world, including to Nepal.

        The first case of COVID-19 in Nepal was confirmed on January 23, 2020, in a person who had returned from Wuhan, China. Since then, the number of cases in Nepal has fluctuated, with surges occurring at different times throughout the pandemic. As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, there had been over 787,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 11,000 deaths in Nepal.
        
        The Nepalese government implemented various measures to try to control the spread of the virus, including lockdowns, travel restrictions, and mass testing. However, the pandemic has had significant impacts on Nepal's economy and healthcare system, with many people losing their jobs and struggling to access healthcare during the crisis.
        
        The vaccination campaign in Nepal started on January 27, 2021, with the arrival of the first batch of vaccines from India. As of my knowledge cutoff date, over 12% of the population had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with the government continuing to work towards increasing the vaccination coverage.</p></i>
